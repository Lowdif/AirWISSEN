To run the website locally, please install npm if it isn't already done, and execute the command:
'npm install' (installs all modules present in the package.json file; those are necessary for the application to work).

Once that is done, run the server by first setting the directory to the 'server' folder (this can be done by using the built in visual studio command promp, or an external one if needed). Then, execute the command 'nodemon server.js'.
